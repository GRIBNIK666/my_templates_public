#
#What‚Äôs the difference between up, run, and start?üîó
#Typically, you want docker-compose up. 
#Use up to start or restart all the services defined in a docker-compose.yml. 
#In the default ‚Äúattached‚Äù mode, you see all the logs from all the containers. 
#In ‚Äúdetached‚Äù mode (-d), Compose exits after starting the containers, 
#but the containers continue to run in the background.
#
#The docker-compose run command is for running ‚Äúone-off‚Äù or ‚Äúadhoc‚Äù tasks. 
#It requires the service name you want to run and only starts containers for services 
#that the running service depends on. 
#Use run to run tests or perform an administrative task such as removing 
#or adding data to a data volume container. 
#The run command acts like docker run -ti in 
#that it opens an interactive terminal to the container and returns an exit status
#matching the exit status of the process in the container.
#
#The docker-compose start command is useful only to restart containers that were previously created, but were stopped. It never creates new containers.
